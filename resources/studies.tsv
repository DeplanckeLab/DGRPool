Genetic, molecular and physiological basis of variation in <i>Drosophila</i> gut immunocompetence	2015	10.1038/ncomms8829	2	The phenotyping data (<i>PE</i> resistance) was extracted from the Supplementary Table 1 from the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8829#Sec22">Supplementary Information</a> file.<br/><br/> The <i>Ecc15</i> resistance data were obtained directly from the authors.	To investigate the determinants underlying inter-individual variation in gut immunocompetence, this study performed enteric infection of 140 Drosophila lines with the entomopathogenic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas entomophila (PE)</i> and observed extensive variation in survival. To determine if this variability in survival is specific to enteric infection, the authors assessed the susceptibility of DGRP lines to systemic infection with <i>Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15 (Ecc15)</i>.

Host Genetic Control of the Microbiota Mediates the <i>Drosophila</i> Nutritional Phenotype	2016	10.1128/AEM.03301-15	89	Assignments to taxonomic ranks were performed in QIIME using the <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/AEM.03006-05">Greengenes</a> database (class, order, family, genus, species). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were binned based on QIIME taxonomic assignments during correlation analysis and numbered from OTU001 to OTU176. It resulted in 76 OTUs (thus 76 phenotypes) after filtering.<br/><br/> Phenotyping data were extracted from Table S1B in <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/suppl/10.1128/AEM.03301-15/suppl_file/zam999116867sd2.xlsx">zam999116867sd2.xlsx</a> file in Supplemental material section.

Genetic architecture of natural variation in cuticular hydrocarbon composition in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>	2015	10.7554/eLife.09861	66	Linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation <i>n</i>-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number. For example, tricosane is designated <i>n</i>-C23.<br /> Methyl-branched alkanes are referred to with a y-Me-Cx prefix, where 'y' is the carbon onto which the methyl group is bound.

It's a group of long-chain hydrocarbons that are produced and secreted by the epidermis (outer layer of skin) and play an important role in protecting the insect’s body from desiccation in dry habitats. They also serve as chemical signals that mediate social interactions and behavior. This study looks into CHC composition as a species-specific blend of fatty acid-derived apolar lipids on the epicuticle and uncovered 24 genes that may be involved in CHC manufacture.

Genome-wide analysis in <i>Drosophila</i> reveals age-specific effects of SNPs on fitness traits	2014	10.1038/ncomms5338	12	Phenotypes loaded here cannot be found on the journal's website.	This study observed the extensive natural variation in lifespan, lifetime fecundity (number of eggs) and age-specific fecundity in mated female fruit flies at different ages (1wk, 3wk, 5wk, and 7wk). The authors conducted a genome-wide analysis to examine the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on these phenotypes and found that the impact of these SNPs was age-specific. These findings highlight the importance of considering the age at which phenotypes are measured in evolutionary studies.	Life history traits,Ageing,Fecundity	integrated	FBrf0225589

This study utilized natural variation in food consumption in the DGRP lines to identify and functionally validate novel genes and a SNP affecting food intake. They also studied the extraordinary sexual dimorphism between male and female lines. Most of the uncovered genes have mammalian orthologs that are implicated in the development of many metabolically related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, while not generally affecting food intake volume directly.

Genome-wide association study of sleep in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>	2013	10.1186/1471-2164-14-281	14	Phenotyping data was downloaded from <b>Additional file 3</b> in <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-14-281#Sec15">Electronic supplementary material</a> section.<br/><br/> Of note, we only have the average values for each DGRP line, not the results per fly.<br/><br/> <b>Definition:</b> Sleep bouts = sleep naps.	This study studies the sleep duration, the number of sleep bouts or ‘naps’, and the average sleep bout length during the day and night of male and female flies. Genome-wide association (GWA) study of sleep identified candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with differences in the mean as well as the environmental sensitivity of sleep traits. These SNPs typically had sex-specific or sex-biased effects, and were generally located in non-coding regions. Several of the candidate genes have human homologs that were identified in studies of human sleep, suggesting that genes affecting variation in sleep are conserved across species.

16	Howick et al.	The genetic architecture of defence as resistance to and tolerance of bacterial infection in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>	2017	10.1111/mec.14017	5	Phenotyping data were extracted from the <b>Table S1</b> in the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.14017#support-information-section">Supporting Information</a> section.<br/><br/> The definition of <b>"Tolerance"</b> and how it is calculated in this study is explained in the first Result section of the paper. 	Defense against pathogenic infection can take two forms: resistance and tolerance. Resistance is the ability of the host to limit a pathogen burden, whereas tolerance is the ability to limit the negative consequences of infection at a given level of infection intensity. This study performed a genomewide association study to map the genetic basis of variation in resistance to and tolerance of infection of five- to nine-day-old mated female flies, which were infected with the Gram-negative bacterium <i>Providencia rettgeri</i>. The results of the study indicate that tolerance is not an independent strategy from resistance.	Immunity,Resistance	integrated	FBrf0235063

Similarly, inversion phenotypes were recoded as 0 (ST/ST), 1 (INV/ST) and 2 (INV/INV).	This study produced the genotyping data for the main 205 genotyped DGRP lines. Afterward, the authors mainly focused on genome architecture and population genetics traits such as inversion landscape, or relatedness of the DGRP lines (which mainly comes from the inversions), or variations in genome sizes. The authors also measured <i>Wolbachia pipientis</i> infection status, which extends the measurements done in the DGRP original study. It's worth noting that many of these phenotypes were recognized as covariates and thus are now standardly used as such for all GWAS analyses of the DGRP lines.

This study investigates the age-related locomotor impairment caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), a common byproduct of mitochondrial energy metabolism, which can also be induced by exogenous sources, including UV light, radiation, and environmental toxins. Here, the authors assessed the locomotion of aged flies on standard medium and following chronic exposure to medium supplemented with 3 mM menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB), as a proxy for ROS-induced locomotor decline.

While these flies tend to avoid mushrooms in nature, some DGRP lines are surprisingly resistant to α-amanitin. This resistance may represent a pre-adaptation, which might enable this species to invade the mushroom niche in the future. Genes linked to this resistance seem linked to the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway. The authors suggest that endocytosis and autophagy of α-amanitin, followed by lysosomal degradation of the toxin, is one of the mechanisms that confer α-amanitin resistance in the DGRP lines.

Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Tolerance to Methylmercury Toxicity in <i>Drosophila</i> Implicates Myogenic and Neuromuscular Developmental Pathways	2014	10.1371/journal.pone.0110375	11	The development of flies exposed to MeHg during larval and pupal stages was measured by scoring eclosion (adult hatching) as a phenotypic endpoint.<br/> The eclosion index was calculated by normalizing the mean eclosion rate for each MeHg concentration to the eclosion on 0 µM MeHg for each strain.<br/> The cumulative eclosion index was generated by summing the normalized percent eclosion values obtained on the 5, 10, and 15 µM MeHg treatments for each strain.<br/><br/> Phenotyping data come from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110375.s005">Table S3</a> in the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110375#s6">Supporting information</a> section.	Methylmercury (MeHg) is a persistent environmental toxin present in seafood that can compromise the developing nervous system in humans. This study examined how genetic variation impacts MeHg tolerance, by assessing developmental tolerance (measured by eclosion rate) to different MeHg concentrations. In addition, the development of MeHg food supplemented with caffeine, a previously identified dietary modifier of MeHg toxicity in fly development was examined.

The aggression score corresponds to the number of aggressive encounters (wing threats, charges, head butts, chases, kicks, and boxing) that was scored for 2 min in the same vial. In the eight fly assays, all aggressive encounters from all flies in the group were summed to give a single aggression score per replicate vial.

Host genetic determinants of microbiota-dependent nutrition revealed by genome-wide analysis of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>	2015	10.1038/ncomms7312	1	Despite being a study about microbiota-dependent nutrition, we could not find any other phenotypes than the Wolbachia Status in this study?<br/> <br/> Phenotyping data is available from Supp Table S6 in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7312#Sec14">supplementary data</a> section.	This study examined the genetic basis for how gut microbiota affect five nutritional traits (weight, protein, lipid, glucose, and glycogen contents) in fruit flies. The authors found significant genotype-dependent variations in these traits when the microbiota were eliminated, identifying specific genetic polymorphisms associated with these variations and validating key genes involved in these microbiota-dependent nutritional effects. Additionally, they observed that the presence of the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia influenced glycogen content, with Wolbachia-positive lines showing higher glycogen levels compared to Wolbachia-free lines.
